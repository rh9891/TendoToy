## Description

Tendo Toy is a toy program that collects patient feedback after an appointment. The program is a full-stack application built using Node, React, Express, and MongoDB. The Material UI CSS framework was used heavily to implement a simple and customizable application. The application also utilizes Redux for state management.

A script was provided with the type of questions that the patient was to be asked and the expected behavior of the user in using the application. Sample data was also provided in JSON format with the patient, doctor, and appointment details, which were loaded and rendered to be utilized in the given script.
